# dollar_store_git
My attempt at building Git based on wyag tutorial.

First objective will be to follow the tutorial.

Afterwards I will try to add some other simple features to get it closer to the actual Git tool. 

The purpose of this is to review Git, and get an even deeper understanding of this tool.

Most of us use it daily, and basic knowledge of it is enough, but I just wanted to deepen it a little more.
